
To fix:

Work on Calc_Func to make it function better and also separate all calculations into their own functions so user can choose an option instead of just showing all data at once.

Rename a few variable to match language, used swedish for myself at the start to keep up and recognize variable use easeier under the proccess off making the functions.

Make the array better, use sizeof to make it not just limited to 10 values. Might not be needed so will see later on if i want to use it or not.

More to add, can't come up with anything right now that i've noticed at this moment.

IMPORTANT!
Missing sort function
Missing find value function
Overlook and refine comments
